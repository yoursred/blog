# April 14, 2022

This is my first time doing a blog thing.

Not much has happened in my life recently. No class ~~tomorrow~~ today, so I'll have some time to clean up my apartment (things are somewhat messy).

I am expecting to apply for a new university on Friday, assuming the bank decides that my money is indeed rightfully mine. If I get admitted before the end of Ramadan, I hope to visit my home city for the holiday, I really missed the sunlight.

## Random bit of code
Linked list implementation in C.
  ```c
//...
typedef unsigned int l_data;

struct list_struct {
    l_data data;
    struct list_struct *next;
    struct list_struct *prev;
};

typedef struct list_struct l_list;
//...
  ```

## Some random photos
These were taken in the last few months.
